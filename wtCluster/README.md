# wtCluster
2015-2016
School Based Tech Interns 
 (20Time Project Documentation)

Wills Davis and Taylan Unal's 20Time project for Mr. Wightman.

Project Goals: Build a cluster to teach networking skills to students interested in networking and computing in afterschool Networking Club.
Once properly implemented, the cluster should be able to compile and run C, Python, and possibly Java programs in parallel.

Requirements:
-At least two computers (assuming working RAM, HDD, CPU, possible GPU)
-At least two CAT5 or higher network cables
-Ubuntu bootable USB Drive or CD.
-Willingness to learn, and adapt, and learn, then start all over again, just to learn more.

Implementation:

In order to start a cluster on any set of computers in this implementation, requires each system to be running a derivation of the Debian architecture of Linux. 
Most computers don't carry multiple Network Interface Cards or (NICs), so one must be installed into the systems set to be running in parallel. 
Note: It is also possible for systems to be linked on a switch; however for this implementation, for two computers, it is most reasonable to simply utilize a direct connection between the computers.

Steps:
0.5: First, obtain permission from your network administrator, manager, or parents, before starting up this project, as it is possible for you to draw too much power, cause excessive heat, damage components, and or ruin network settings. 
Still with us?... Good.

1: Now make sure that you have downloaded Ubuntu from http://www.ubuntu.com/download for your specific version. 
Remember that if you have an older system with less than 4GB of RAM, that you choose the x86 edition of Ubuntu, but if you have a newer system with more than 4GB of RAM, download the x64 edition of Ubuntu.
For our project, we will be using Ubuntu Desktop, and not Ubuntu Server, as it provides a graphical interface that is important for user end implementation.
Follow the tutorial http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows for Windows, or http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx for OSX in order to create a bootable Ubuntu drive with which you will create the Ubuntu filesystem on your computer.

2: Now, with bootable drive and computers ready, it is time to begin installation. Make sure that you have your keyboard and monitor plugged in to the computer that you are going to be installing Ubuntu on first. Make sure that you have backed up all your data from the harddrive that you will be using, or are using an empty drive for this project. 
Plug in your Ubuntu USB drive into an empty slot in your computer and be ready to go through multiple forced restarts as you figure out which function key prompts the boot order menu. Use your arrow keys to select the USB drive, and let the wizard guide you through installation.
