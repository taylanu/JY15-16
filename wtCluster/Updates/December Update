DECEMBER 2015

December Update:
As well as planning our club’s focus in class, we have also been testing desktops for functionality, and have already found that two of the desktops are not functional. We have continued to test the other two computers, but have found a myriad of problems that seem to occur without our understanding of the problems. As of now, we have had one computer with video issues that only occur while memory testing, and another one that wouldn’t accept boot devices. Wills has begun the process of officially instantiating the club with the activities office. We will continue to learn and build the computers.
