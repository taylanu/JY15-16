Systems Club 
An Intro to Linux & Software Architecture

Goal: Build an extracurricular activity centered around educating students about computers and networks; to help them gain an interest in the field.
 
Stretch goals: Eventually we will create a beowulf cluster of desktop computers with our goal to create a “supercomputer” to do parallel processing and host our ftp and VM.

Audience: Those interested in learning computer science.Who want to build upon their own knowledge and experience collaborative systems engineering. 

Documentation & Organization: All club documents will be stored on a central Google Drive and a server (VM) will be made available throughout the duration of the club for members to work on gaining levels of access, cleaning server connections, and learning about network structures

Timeline: Interest meeting within the month, with prepared slides and clear message. Assigning tasks for people to complete and we gauge interest based on what they will learn, a basic curriculum will be set. Every meeting, we will put up our achievements on a wordpress blog made for our club.
