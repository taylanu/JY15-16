-Board will be 9*9 so for loops will go from 0->9 exclusive or 0->8 inclusive
-Board will have 9 sub-grids, each with 3*3 grids
-The game will likely have prebuilt setups, instead of instantaneous generation.
-Game can only have values of 1-9 in the cells. 

Rules:
Each subboard will have some cells filled out already with values from 1-9, but the board is guaranteed not to be filled completely.
Each row can only contain one instance of the number, and each column can only include one instance of the number.

A row will have at least 1 value filled, but no more than 9 values filled upon instantiation.
