Battleship SparseMatrix Documentation

AI:
AI will first fire at random on the board, and then once it delivers a hit, it will call next method that will shoot... 

(Option1)Either right or left of the target with random,
	else if either right or left returns a false, it will shoot above or below the block that returned the hit. //look up max length of ship so that loop goes until that (value/2)+1 to be safe.
(Option2)As long as the AI doesnt hit a ship, shoots at a random position on the array.
	
Setup:
Each player has a one length 2 ship, two length 3 ships, one length 4 ship, one length 5 ship
