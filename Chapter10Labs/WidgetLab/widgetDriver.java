 * Create a Widget class that implements Comparable.  
 * Put in constructors, accessors, modifiers, and any needed instance methods.
 * In the main() method, create an array of Widgets. Read the data, pounds on one line and ounces on the
 * next line, from widget.txt. For this assignment, just ignore the name field.  
 * Than call any of your sort(Comparable[]) methods, passing the Widget array.
