Project 10-5 Instructions

Design a class hierarchy for bank accounts. The concrete types of accounts are checking accounts, savings accounts, 
and credit accounts. Common behavior includes deposits, withdrawals, and obtaining a balance. Credit and savings accounts 
have an interest rate. Credit accounts have a credit line or maximum amount that may be borrowed. 
Be sure your design includes the appropriate interface, abstract class, and concrete classes.
