The Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divbisor (gcd) of two positive integers (n1, n2).

You can use this algorithm in the following manner:
A. Compute the remainder of dividing the larger number by the smaller number.
B. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.
C. Repeat process until smaller number is zero.
Larger number is now the gcd of n1 and n2.

Write a program that lets user enter two integers and then prints each step in process using Euclidean algorithm to find gcd.
