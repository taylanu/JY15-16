Project 12-1 Instructions

Use a Tester program to implement and test a recursive method to compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers. 
The recursive definition of a gcd is:

So, correct 12.1 specifications:  given user input of two integers, 
find the greatest common divisor using the correct recursive algorithm.	
gcd(a, b) = a, when b = 0
gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b), when a > 0
