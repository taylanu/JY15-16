Proposed to Mr.Wightman, but will likely only happen next year, if ever.

Galleria of Code..
Imagine a galleria of code, a day where students can come together, just as we do with the Art Fair, where ANY student can submit programs to. One day, possibly after SOL’s end, we could have a day during lunch, where students can come down to the AUX gym, or the dance studio, and view their peer’s creations.
From simple programs that tell you the weather today, to simple chat bots, to more complex programs like games, clients, or interactive user interfaces.
All that we need is a spark powerful enough to keep the computer science interest blaze alive. I truly believe that students will love sharing their creations with their peers and teachers.
This fair will serve the student, their classmates, the school, and the greater interest market for computer science.
Hopefully, I’ll be able to build a project outline and server where students can submit their programs and have it display on the code gallery for both students and the world to see.
