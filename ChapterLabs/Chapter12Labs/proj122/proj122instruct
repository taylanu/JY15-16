Project 12-2 Instruct

Write a recursive method that returns a string with the characters in reverse order and test the method with a Tester program.
The string and index position should be parameters. If the position is less than the string's length, recurse with the rest of
the string after this position and return the result of appending the character at this position to the result,
otherwise, return the empty string.

Project 12.2 � the book asks for a method that shows the reverse of a string given a word and an index (to define substrings).  The recursive algorithm for finding the reverse of a string is best written as a single argument method, that given a string, returns the reverse of the string.
So, better 12.2 specifications:  write a recursive method that is sent a single string argument (word), and returns a string that is the reverse of word.
				public static String reverse (String word)
The method can be called in a main function like this:
				SOP(�Enter a word:�);
				String word = input.next();
				String ans = reverse(word);
				SOP(�The reverse of �+ word � + � is � + ans);
