Big O Notation:
Efficiency correlates directly with runtime.
-Amount of work an algorithm has to do.

Constant time: is O(1) or every process takes same amount of time regardless of inputs.
	- Distance method formula is an example of constant time.
	- If no inputs, no loops, and no recursion => Constant Time O(1)
	- Negligible difference in amount of work Java does

Linear time: is O(n) or every additional input requires that unit value's extra amount of time.
	- countDown method formula is an example of linear time
	- sprint method is an example of linear time
	- Negligible difference in amount of work Java does
	- Single loop

Quadratic Time: is O(n^2,n^3,n^4)
	- as input size increases by n^a power
	- with nested loops only. Count number of nested loops, that depend on the input size.
