proj53 instructions:

Develop a new class for representing fractions. The numerator and denominator of a fraction are integers. 
The constructor expects these values as parameters. Define accessor methods to obtain the numberator and the denominator. 
Use the rules of fraction arithmetic to define methods to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions.
Each of these methods expects a fraction object as a parameter. This object is considered to be the right operand
of the operation. The left operand is the reciever object, that is, the one containing the instance  variables for the
numerator and denominator. Each arithmetic method builds a new instance of the fraction class with the results of its
calculation and returns it as the method's value. Finally include a toString() method that returns a string of the form
<numerator>/<denominator>. Write a tester program that excercises all of the methods.

Check book for fraction arithmetic rules if needed.
