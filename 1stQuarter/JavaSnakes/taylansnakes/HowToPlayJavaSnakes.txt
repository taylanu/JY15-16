Java Snakes

Navigate your snake, avoiding walls, your tail and the tail of your opponent.
Try to box in your opponent, causing them to crash.  Each player has 3 lives.

Powerups may appear to be consumed by a player:
   *Flower powerups will make the recipient grow.  The number in the flower denotes the size that the snake will grow.
   
   *Blue flowers will cause the snake to separate from its tail, leaving it as a wall in the map.
   
   *Red flowers will give the snake a larger head, and with it the ability to run through one wall or snake tail.
    When striking a snakes tail with the Red powerup, the tail will separate at the point of impact and be left as a wall.

Points are gained by eating powerups and surviving each round.  Extra points are earned if you cause your opponent to hit your tail.
